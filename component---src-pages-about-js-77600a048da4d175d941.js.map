I felt\n          like I should learn 'hacking' too, it's a pretty useful skill for my\n          future.\n        </p>\n        <h3>[Hello World] and First sin</h3>\n        <p>\n          With my{' '}\n          <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/products/hp-mini-110/specs/\">\n            HP Mini 110\n          </a>{' '}\n          and ubuntu Lucid Lynx and I learn how to write my Hello World with C\n          and gcc. I don't understand what I did at first but I really belived\n          that I know how to 'hack' things with a computer (well our high school\n          delusion did a bad thing here).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Then I started to learn how to 'cheat' in facebook online games \"Wild\n          Ones\", with using cheat engine and analyzed where should I manipulate\n          the value to enchance my charactes and it works! (Sorry, devs).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          After graduated from high school I decided to learn computer sciences\n          and fortunately I got some scholarship from Universitas Gunadarma, and\n          I choose IT major in there.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Change of Heart</h3>\n        <p>\n          It was Second year of my college, and I did nothing but, learning ->\n          playing games -> practice code. And then my friends told me about IT\n          Laboratory is opening positions for Assistant. I was ignoring it at\n          first because I did not have any interest to teaching others or\n          talking in front of people.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Honestly, I was an Introvert, I have hard time to talk with someone\n          else. Even I can't maintain eye contact while talking with others.\n          But, there's something in my heart told me to join IT Laboratory as an\n          Assistant. Also I need money too :).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So I joined, and worked with them for 2 years and 6 months, and I\n          really happy working with my teamate, and I have learned a lot of soft\n          skills, like how to talking with others, how to teach others, how to\n          talk in the front of people. I really glad that I could be part of\n          them.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Working!!</h3>\n        <p>\n          Now I'm working fulltime at{' '}\n          <a href=\"https://hara.ag\">Hara Technology</a> as a Front-end engineer,\n          and I do other stuffs like teaching, and consulting too.\n        </p>\n      </article>\n    </HomeLayout>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
